/**
 * @mainpage The CPEN333 Process and Thread Library
 *
 * @section sec_intro Introduction
 *
 * This library is designed to simplify usage of many of the
 * inter-thread and inter-process synchronization and communication mechanisms taught in
 * the CPEN333 course at UBC.  It consists mainly of a collection of classes that wrap
 * around platform-specific code, providing a uniform interface.
 *
 * @section sec_usage Usage
 *
 * This is a header-only library, meaning that no compilation is required.  Simply put the
 * root `cpen333` folder in a known location, and add its path to the set of include directories.  On `gcc`, this
 * can be accomplished by adding the `-I<path to cpen333>` directive.
